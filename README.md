# Why is Measuring Culture So Important?

Culture silently guides our decisions and processes. Without understanding the impact of culture on new initiatives and existing work patterns, we can fail to see why our plans don't succeed like we expect them to.

Engineering culture can be broken out into multiple aspects such as levels of co-operation, receptiveness to new ideas, accountbility, aptitude for bridging, risk and failure management. With the right questions and enough answers, you can start to objectively measure your team or organization's culture.

Measuring aspects of your organization's culture is the first step in identifying problem areas, building on your strengths, and planning for improvements. As time progresses, re-assessment and comparison helps to visualize the change in these areas. As you prioritize improvements and continue to track impact trends, you'll begin to expose elements of causality and learn what really works for your environment.
